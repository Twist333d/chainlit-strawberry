# Chainlit Strawberry üçì

This project is a chatbot application that uses OpenAI's latest model, o1-preview, to generate responses. It's built with Chainlit, providing a seamless chat interface for interacting with the AI.

## Features

- Utilizes OpenAI's o1-preview model for state-of-the-art language processing
- Implements a conversational memory to maintain context throughout the chat
- Built with Chainlit for an intuitive and responsive chat interface
- Handles API errors gracefully

- Python 3.7+
- An OpenAI API key

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Twist333d/chainlit-strawberry.git
   cd chainlit-strawberry
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
